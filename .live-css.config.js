/*
    This configuration file is used for running "live-css" server (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webextensions/live-css)
    It is meant to be used along with browser extension "Live editor for CSS, Less & Sass - Magic CSS":
        https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor

    To generate this file, download and install Node JS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
    After that:
        $ npm install -g @webextensions/live-css
        $ cd <project-folder>
        $ live-css --init
        --------OR--------
        Copy the default configuration file from:
            https://github.com/webextensions/live-css-editor/tree/master/live-css/default.live-css.config.js
        and save it as a file with name ".live-css.config.js" (note that the file name begins with a dot character)

    // The "port" configuration option is used as a suggested port number when the live-css server needs to run
    // on a separate port of its own. If the specified port is busy, the next available port may be used.
    // It will be used when:
    //     - you run live-css from command-line
    //     - you run live-css in a Node JS project using require() syntax, but do not pass the "httpServer" option
    "port": 3456,                           // Recommended value: A number between 1024 and 49151
                                            // The "live-css" server would start at this port number

    // IMPORTANT NOTE: Setting "root" to an incorrect value may result in failure to auto-refresh styles in the browser.
    //                 If you are in doubt, don't use the "root" configuration option, live-css would still work fine.
    // Keeping "root" configuration option as commented out by default
    // "root": ".",                         // <relative-or-absolute-path>
                                            // This path should point to the root ("/") of your web server for which you are using live-css.
                                            // For example,
                                            //     If http://localhost/ points to /path/to/project/http-pub/
                                            //     And this configuration file is placed at /path/to/project/
                                            //     Then, you may use "root": "http-pub" <OR> "root": "/path/to/project/http-pub"
                                            // This is the root folder which contains the files you wish to watch for changes
                                            // This folder would be scanned recursively for files matching the "watch-patterns"
                                            // while skipping the files matching the "watch-ignore-patterns"
